## Machine Learning!
In this repository, I’ve documented my entire journey of exploring machine learning and tried to present it in a clear and intuitive structure.

- The [RoadMap](Machine_Learning/Roadmap/) folder holds my learning notes — the trail of how I taught myself step by step — while the [WorkSpace](Machine_Learning/WorkSpace/) folder goes deeper, containing my actual code and detailed mathematical derivations (best viewed in Jupyter Notebooks, where LaTeX formulas render perfectly).

- In GitHub’s Markdown, some formulas may not display correctly, so I recommend checking the notebooks under the [Algorithms File](Machine_Learning/WorkSpace/00_Algorithms.ipynb) for a complete view.
