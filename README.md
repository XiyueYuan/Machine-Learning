In this repository, I’ve documented my entire journey of exploring machine learning, and tried to present it in a clear and intuitive structure. The Roadmap folder holds my learning notes — the trail of how I taught myself step by step — while the WorkSpace folder goes deeper, containing my actual code and detailed mathematical derivations (I use Jupyter Notebook since it’s perfect for rendering LaTeX formulas).

In the README, I collect some of the most fascinating and elegant formulas — those beautiful algorithms that are both mathematically profound and intellectually inspiring. They’re what make me fall in love with the blend of computer science and mathematics.
