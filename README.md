## Machine Learning!
In this repository, I’ve documented my entire journey of exploring machine learning, and tried to present it in a clear and intuitive structure. 
- The [RoadMap](Roadmap/) folder holds my learning notes — the trail of how I taught myself step by step — while the [WorkSpace](WorkSpace/) folder goes deeper, containing my actual code and detailed mathematical derivations (I use Jupyter Notebook since it’s perfect for rendering LaTeX formulas).

- Mathematical formulas are best viewed in the Jupyter notebooks under the WorkSpace folder [Algorithms File](WorkSpace/00_Algorithms.ipynb), since GitHub does not fully support LaTeX rendering in Markdown.
